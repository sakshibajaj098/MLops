# MLops Project - Simplified Machine Learning Operations

This project demonstrates a simplified MLops pipeline for a basic machine learning project using essential tools. The pipeline includes version control, automated testing, and model deployment.

## Project Structure

- `train_model.py`: Python script for training a machine learning model.
- `Dockerfile`: Dockerfile for containerizing the machine learning model and its dependencies.
- `tests.py`: Unit tests for the machine learning code.
- `.travis.yml`: Configuration file for Travis CI.

## Steps

### Step 1: Version Control (GitHub)

1. Created a [https://github.com/sakshibajaj098/MLops) for version control.
2. Initialized the repository with a README file.

### Step 2: Docker Containerization

1. Created a Dockerfile to containerize the machine learning model and its dependencies.
2. Built a Docker image from the Dockerfile.

### Step 3: Cloud Deployment

1. Deployed the Dockerized machine learning model to a cloud platform.
2. Documented the deployment process and provided the endpoint/URL to access the model.

### Step 4: Automated Testing

1. Wrote unit tests for the machine learning code.
2. Set up a continuous integration (CI) pipeline using Travis CI to run the tests automatically on every push.
3. Documented the testing process and results.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Logging (Optional)

1. Used Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring and visualizing the model's performance (optional).
2. Set up centralized logging using the ELK Stack (optional).

## Final Submission

1. Ensured that the GitHub repository is well-organized and contains all necessary documentation.
2. Submitted the link to the GitHub repository to the instructor/evaluator for evaluation.
